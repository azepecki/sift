## INTRODUCTION

Sift is a programming language designed to optimize text processing and filtering for natural language processing (NLP) applications. Sift draws inspiration from the elegance of Câ€™s syntax while adding its own unique flair. This imperative language is designed for users with some programming experience as knowledge of C or a similar language will allow users to instantly recognize and understand the basic structure of Sift. However, it is the text-specific processing tools that make Sift stand out as the best language to use for NLP purposes; piping, filtering, and basic tokenization functionality give users the tools they need to seamlessly integrate Sift into their existing or future NLP workflows.
